1. "Q" and "E" abilities currently do nothing and lock the player out of inputting other commands
2. Boss's pillar summoning takes way too long
3. Boss level should start in darkness
4. Sword should have some stun/knockback so it feels less clunky to use (or could reduce swing duration)
5. Assassination opportunities should be visually clearer
6. Assassinating an enemy should alert all nearby enemies
7. One of the enemies in level 2 has an invisible spotlight sometimes
